# api.lovd.nl
This repository hosts the code for the generic LOVD APIs
 that are available at api.LOVD.nl.
The code for these APIs is available under the terms of the GPLv3 license.





<!-- Based on the LOVD3 manual -->
## Terms of service and fair use policy
If you wish to use the APIs directly through `api.lovd.nl`, then please follow
 the following terms of service and fair use policy.

- Read the API possibilities below carefully, and choose the most efficient
   method to query the API &mdash; meaning, the least amount of requests to get
   the information you need.
- Limit your requests to a maximum of 5 per second per server/domain name.
- Not required, but appreciated; please set a `User-agent` string that
   identifies you, so we can see how the service is being used and we can
   contact you if necessary.





## Installation
If you wish to run a copy of these APIs locally, all you need is to place the
 files in the `src` directory in a location that is available to a PHP-enabled
 web server such as Apache.
